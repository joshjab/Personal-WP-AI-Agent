My name is Joshua Jablonowski. I'm a software and systems engineer, technical lead, father, and serial hobbyist. I was born and raised in Huntsville, AL and have always enjoyed computers and technical challenges as is the case for most in Rocket City.
When I can find the time, I love flying small single engine airplanes out of Redstone Arsenal, AL and embarking on personal projects to learn new things and keep up with the latest tech.
